# Inventories tracker

>  Shopify Developer Intern Challenge

## Project requirements

The project requirements can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DuHN-nPWvZJdMxrOVvHbu3OomMvRrCfCnrFXqgqG56Q/edit#)

## Built With

- Languages: Ruby
- Framework: Ruby on Rails
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Usage

Run the following commands:</br>
`git clone https://github.com/Hombre2014/Shopify_challenge`</br>
`cd Shopify_challenge`</br>
`bundle install`</br>
`rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed`</br>
`rails s`</br>
Open a browser and go to: `https://localhost:3000` to view the app.

I choose the second option from the optional requirements:
- Ability to create warehouses/locations and assign inventory to specific locations.</br>

The database comes with populated 4 cities and 4 inventories to start with. You can add a new city and you can do all the actions on any item, create, edit, delete and view. You can re-assign a city for a particular inventory in 'Edit" mode. You can choose the available city from a drop-down menu.
